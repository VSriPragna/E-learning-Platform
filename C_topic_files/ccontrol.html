	<h3>The if Statement</h3>
	<p>Use the if statement to specify a block of C code to be executed if a condition is true.</p>
	<p>Syntax:</p>
	<p>if (condition) {</p>
	<p>// block of code to be executed if the condition is true</p>
	<p>}</p>
	<br>
	<h3>The else Statement</h3>
	<p>Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.</p>
	<p>if (condition) {</p>
 <p> // block of code to be executed if the condition is true</p>
<p>} else {</p>
 <p> // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}</p>
<br>
<h3>Switch Statement</h3>
<p>Instead of writing many if..else statements, you can use the switch statement.

The switch statement selects one of many code blocks to be executed.</p>
<p>Syntax:</p>
<p>switch(expression) {</p>
<p>case x:</p>
<p>// code block</p>
<p> break;</p>
<p>default:</p>
<p>// code block</p>
<p>}</p>
<br>
<h3>The break Keyword</h3>
<p>When C reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.

This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block.

When a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break. There is no need for more testing.</p>
<br>
<h3>The default Keyword</h3>
<p>The default keyword specifies some code to run if there is no case match.</p>
<br>
<h3>Loops:</h3>
<p>Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.

Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.</p>
<h3>While Loop</h3>
<p>The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.</p>
<p>Syntax:</p>
<p>while (condition) {</p>
	<p>// block of code to be executed </p>
	<p>}</p>
	<br>
<h3>The Do/While Loop</h3>
<p>The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.</p>
<p>Syntax:</p>
<p>do{</p>
	<p>// block of code to be executed </p>
	<p>}</p>
	<p>while (condition);</p>
	<br>
	<h3>C For Loop</h3>
	<p>When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop:</p>
	<p>for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {</p>
	<p>// block of code to be executed </p>
	<p>}</p>
	<p>Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.</p>

<p>Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.</p>

<p>Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.</p>
