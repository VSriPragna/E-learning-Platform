Packages</h1>

	<h3>Java Packages</h3>
	<p>A package in Java is used to group related classes. Think of it as a folder in a file directory. We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code. Packages are divided into two categories:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API)</li>
    <li>User-defined Packages (create your own packages)
</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
<h3>Built-in Packages</h3>
<p>The Java API is a library of prewritten classes, that are free to use, included in the Java Development Environment.</p>
<p>he library is divided into packages and classes. Meaning you can either import a single class (along with its methods and attributes), or a whole package that contain all the classes that belong to the specified package.</p>
<p>To use a class or a package from the library, you need to use the import keyword.</p>
<br>
<h3>Import a Class</h3>
<p>If you find a class you want to use, for example, the Scanner class, which is used to get user input, write the following code.</p>
<p>import java.util.Scanner;</p>
<br>
<h3>Import a Package</h3>
<p>There are many packages to choose from. In the previous example, we used the Scanner class from the java.util package. This package also contains date and time facilities, random-number generator and other utility classes.</p>
<p>To import a whole package, end the sentence with an asterisk sign (*). The following example will import ALL the classes in the java.util package.</p>
<br>
<h3>User-defined Packages</h3>
