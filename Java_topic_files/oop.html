<h1 style="text-align: center;color: orange;font-weight: bold;">Java OOP Concept</h1>
	<h3>Java OOP</h3>
	<p>OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.</p>
<p>Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:</p>
<ul>
	<li>OOP is faster and easier to execute</li>
	<li>OOP provides a clear structure for the programs</li>
	<li>OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug</li>
	<li>OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Java Classes and Objects</h3>
<p>Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.</p>
<p>A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.</p>
<h3>Create a Class:</h3>
<p>public class Main {</p>
<p>int x = 5;</p>
<p>}</p>
<br>
<p>In Java, an object is created from a class. We have already created the class named Main, so now we can use this to create objects.</p>

<h3>Java Class Attributes</h3>
<p>In the previous chapter, we used the term "variable" for x in the example (as shown below). It is actually an attribute of the class. Or you could say that class attributes are variables within a class.</p>
<h3>Accessing Attributes</h3>
<p>You can access attributes by creating an object of the class, and by using the dot syntax (.):

The following example will create an object of the Main class, with the name myObj. We use the x attribute on the object to print its value.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>public static void main(String[] args) {</p>
<p>Main myObj = new Main();</p>
<p>System.out.println(myObj.x);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<br>
<h3>Java Class Methods</h3>
<p>myMethod() prints a text (the action), when it is called. To call a method, write the method's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon;</p>
<p>public class Main {<br>
  static void myMethod() {<br>
    System.out.println("Hello World!");<br>
  }<br>
  public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
    myMethod();<br>
  }<br>
}<br>
</p>
<br>
<h3>Static vs. Public</h3>
<p>You will often see Java programs that have either static or public attributes and methods.

In the example above, we created a static method, which means that it can be accessed without creating an object of the class, unlike public, which can only be accessed by objects</p>
