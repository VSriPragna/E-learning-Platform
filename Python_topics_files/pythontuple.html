<h1 style="text-align: center;color: orange;font-weight: bold;">Python Tuple</h1>

  <h3>Tuple</h3>
<p>ists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

tuples are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
</p>
<p>thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")</p>
<br>
<h3>tuple Items</h3>
<p>tuple items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.</p>
<br>
<h3>Ordered</h3>
<p>When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

If you add new items to a tuple, the new items will be placed at the end of the tuple.</p>
<br>
<h3>Un Changeable</h3>
<p>Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.

</p>
<br>
<h3>tuple Length</h3>
<p>To determine how many items a tuple has, use the len() function.</p>
<br>
<h3>type()</h3>
<h4></h4>
<p>From Python's perspective, tuples are defined as objects with the data type 'tuple'.</p>

<h3>The tuple() Constructor</h3>
<p>t is also possible to use the tuple() constructor when creating a new tuple.</p>
<br>
<h3>Allow Duplicates</h3>
<p>Since tuples are indexed, tuples can have items with the same value.</p>
