<h1 style="text-align: center;color: orange;font-weight: bold;">Python set</h1>

  <h3>set</h3>
<p>ists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

sets are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are set, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
</p>
<p>thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}</p>
<p> Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.</p>
<br>
<h3>set Items</h3>
<p>set items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

set items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.</p>
<br>
<h3>Un Ordered</h3>
<p>Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.

Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.</p>
<br>
<h3>Un Changeable</h3>
<p>sets are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the set has been created.

</p>
<br>
<h3>set Length</h3>
<p>To determine how many items a set has, use the len() function.</p>
<br>
<h3>type()</h3>
<h4></h4>
<p>From Python's perspective, sets are defined as objects with the data type 'set'.</p>

<h3>The set() Constructor</h3>
<p>t is also possible to use the set() constructor when creating a new set.</p>
<br>
<h3>Duplicates Not Allowed</h3>
<p>Sets cannot have two items with the same value</p>
<br>
