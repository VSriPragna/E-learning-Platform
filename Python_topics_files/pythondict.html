  <h3>dictionary</h3>
<p>ists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

dictionarys are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are dictionary, dictionary, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
</p>
<p>thisdictionary = {"brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964}</p>
<p> Note: dictionary items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.</p>
<br>
<h3>dictionary Items</h3>
<p>dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

dictionary items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.</p>
<br>
<h3>Ordered or Unordered?</h3>
<p>When we say that dictionaries are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

Unordered means that the items does not have a defined order, you cannot refer to an item by using an index.</p>
<br>
<h3>Changeable</h3>
<p>Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.

</p>
<br>
<h3>dictionary Length</h3>
<p>To determine how many items a dictionary has, use the len() function.</p>
<br>
<h3>type()</h3>
<h4></h4>
<p>From Python's perspective, dictionarys are defined as objects with the data type 'dict'.</p>

<h3>The dict() Constructor</h3>
<p>t is also possible to use the dict() constructor when creating a new dictionary.</p>
<br>
<h3>Duplicates Not Allowed</h3>
<p>dictionarys cannot have two items with the same value</p>
